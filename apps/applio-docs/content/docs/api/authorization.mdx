## How to use the API key
Once you have generated an API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the API. To do this, you need to include the API key in the `Authorization` header of your request.

For example, if you have generated an API key with the name `my-api-key`, you can use it to authenticate your requests like this:

```bash
Authorization: my-api-key
```

Make sure to replace `my-api-key` with the actual API key you have generated.
