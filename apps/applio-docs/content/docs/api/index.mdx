## What is Applio API and where can I use it?

Applio API **is the link between your project and our database**. **Our vision is** that your project can **interact with our database with minimal latency**, **making it the fastest API** on RVC models. We offer security, speed and several advanced filtering options.

<Callout type="warn" className="shadow-xl shadow-orange-500/10">
  Applio **API V2** is **currently in closed beta**. We are working hard to make it the best API on RVC models. **If you need it for commercial use**, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@applio.org">support@applio.org</a>.  
</Callout>

## Pricing
**Applio API is free**, but we use a [rate limit method](/api#rate-limit) so that it works properly and we can afford to have a free plan.

### Rate limit
To ensure the proper functioning of **Applio API** and to keep it **completely free**, we limit the number of requests allowed every 24 hours.
