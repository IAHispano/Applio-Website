1. Separate the vocals from the instrumental: [Audio Isolating Guides](/guides/audio-isolating/uvr)

2. Search or download the model you want to use: [Applio Bot](/voice-models/bot) / [Applio Web](https://applio.org/models)

3. Open Applio and make the cover: [Inference Guide](/getting-started/download-models) / [Other Alternatives](/getting-started/other-alternatives), then combine it with the instrumental and youâ€™re done.
