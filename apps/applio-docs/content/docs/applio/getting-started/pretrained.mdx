## What are pretraineds?

When it comes to training, you have two main options: building a model from the ground up or fine-tuning an already existing one. These pre-trained models are designed to streamline your training process, saving time and enhancing the overall quality of your results.

_Simply put, the image illustrates that having a pre-trained model saves you effort during subsequent model training._

## How to create pretraineds?

When creating a pretrained model, you have two primary options to consider.

Firstly, you can either initiate a fine-tuning process on another pretrained model, which could be one of the originals, or start building one from scratch.

Should you opt for building from scratch, the ideal approach involves gathering a substantial amount of moderately clean data (50 hours or more); it doesn't necessarily have to be perfectly pristine. Subsequently, fine-tune this model with high-quality data.

An essential consideration is to construct datasets devoid of copyrighted material.

Alternatively, if you choose to fine-tune a pretrained model, the crux lies in the quality of the audio inputs. You can tailor it to a specific language, incorporate diverse speakers, and even integrate various accents (10 hours or more). The customization possibilities are vast. However, it's crucial to strike a balance; avoid overtraining the pretrained model. The more effectively you fine-tune it now, the less training it will necessitate later during usage.

To embark on building a model from scratch, conduct standard training while disabling the Pretrained option. For fine-tuning, engage in ordinary training while loading the desired pretrained model to fine-tune it.

## How to use pretraineds?

In the training tab, check the **'Custom Pretrained'** box, upload the files, and select it in the **Pretrained G/D Path boxes**.

<Callout type="info" className="shadow-xl shadow-blue-500/10">
 Now you can download the custom pretrained models directly from the **Download** tab in Applio, go to **Download Pretrained Models** and select the **Pretrained** model you want to download, choose the **Sample Rate**, and click on **Download**.

## Where to find pretraineds?

### DMR V1 by Razer
DMR V1 is a fine-tuned based on the original RVC V2 pretrained and made with 11.3 hours dataset and specially only for e-girl, soft male/female and deep male/female voices. This model was trained with Mangio-Crepe/Crepe (Applio) therefore it is advisable to use this extraction algorithm with a 128 hop length or below and have a clean dataset due to the sensitivity to noise of this algorithm. This only supports **32k sample rate**.

### KLM 4.1 by SeoulStreamingStation

KLM 4.1 is a fine-tuned based on KLM V7 pretrained and made with around 100 hours dataset (Korean vocal/speech, Japanese vocal/speech and English speech), so it will work better with those languages. Unlike typical pretrained models KLM is a pretrained model created to make vocal guides using short voice recordings from a studio, this means that even with short dataset high pitch information it is possible to implement high-pitched sounds but it is sensitive to noise so it is recommended to use it with high quality datasets. This only supports **32k and 48k sample rate**.
