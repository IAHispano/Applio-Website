## Common Errors

### Dependencies

In the conda installation method, Applio is installed in a conda environment. This enviroment has all the dependencies needed to run Applio so you don't need to install anything else.

### Error Downloading Miniconda

If there are issues automatically downloading Miniconda, download it [manually](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.9.0-0-Windows-x86_64.exe) and install it.

### Conda Error Building Wheels

If Conda shows an error related to the "Wheels" dependency, check that Visual Studio Build Tools are installed. This requirement it should be installed semi automatically by the installer.

### Tensorboard or dependency error

If an error related to Tensorboard occurs, it's likely that no dependencies were installed correctly. [Review if you have the latest installer version](/applio/getting-started/installation).

#### Also, please check if you have done any of the following:

<Steps>
<Step>
## Did you install applio in a directory with spaces or non ASCII characters in the path?

### Situation with Google Colab

Unfortunately, Google Colab is currently unavailable as Google has taken measures to restrict access to Colab services, including Applio. Thanks to our team, we have been able to bring Applio back. [More information here](/getting-started/other-alternatives).

### FFmpeg error/utf8 error

Ensure paths are free of special characters.

### Connection Error

Ensure the console (black command line window) is open.

### WebUI popup 'Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Disable system LAN proxy/global proxy and refresh.

### Cuda error/Cuda out of memory

Adjust batch size for training; for inference, modify settings in config.py. Consider upgrading the GPU if needed.

### File/memory error(when training)

Reduce "Number of CPU threads" or pre-cut training set to shorter audio files.

### Error about llvmlite.dll

Install [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) for Windows.

### RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor...

Delete smaller-sized wav files, then click "train the model" and "train the index."

### RuntimeError: The size of tensor a must match...

Avoid changing the sampling rate mid-training. If necessary, change the exp name and train from scratch or copy pitch and features folders to accelerate training.

### The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect

Make sure to correctly set the path for your dataset before training. Remember that the dataset should not be in a zip file within the Applio/assets/datasets folder.

### IndexError: list index out of range

Make sure to use the same sample rate when retraining or when selecting a custom pretrain.

### Alternative

If all else fails, download the precompiled (Zip or Exe) version. This will bring everything ready to start applio without the need to perform the installation.
