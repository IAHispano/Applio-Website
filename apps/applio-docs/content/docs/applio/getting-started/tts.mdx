Applio is a speech-to-speech conversion software, utilizing **EdgeTTS** as middleware for running the Text-to-Speech (TTS) component. Please note the following:

- **EdgeTTS** requires an **internet connection** to function.
- We do not plan to add more TTS systems to Applio at this time.
- You **cannot add additional voices** to EdgeTTS beyond what is already provided.
- If you'd like to experiment with other TTS systems, you can use the **ElevenLabs plugin**, or run TTS through another platform and then convert it using Applio.
- This should be considered a **demonstration of Applioâ€™s capabilities**.

Applio also features ElevenLabs TTS extension. Check the [Plugins section](/applio/getting-started/plugins) for more information.
