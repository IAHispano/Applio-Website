## Local

<Step>
### How to install?
<Callout type="warn" className="shadow-xl shadow-orange-500/10">
Important its is only for NVIDIA GPUs
</Callout>


1. On your PC where you wish to store the **KaraFan project** and Go inside it.
2. First, we have to download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe).

3. Download:

- [Install.exe](https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan/wiki/Data/Install.exe) The easiest way! **(auto-extract the BAT)**.
- [Intall.zip](https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan/wiki/Data/Install.zip) Bypass the Browser Security
- [Install.bat](https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan/wiki/Data/Install.bat) Click to show, save it and rename to **Install.bat**.

<Callout type="info" className="shadow-xl shadow-blue-500/10">
  If you have installed Python 3.11 before WITHOUT using this Install.bat, you
  must uninstall it before! Even those installed with the Microsoft Store!
</Callout>

<Callout type="Reactnode" className="shadow-xl shadow-neutral-500/10">
 Important
 On Windows 11, you must allow first the execution of the **BAT file**:

- Right-click on the file
- Choose « Properties »
- In the « General » tab, click on the « Unlock » button
- Click on the « OK » button
</Callout>

4. You must execute it with **Administrator Rights**.

5. Run **Setup.py** by double-clicking on it.

6. Now, you can launch **KaraFan.pyw** by double-clicking on it.
</Step>
<Step>
### How to use?

1. Place your audio in the **Music folder** and copy the **path of your song** that you want to separate and the path of the **folder** where the separated song will be stored.

2. Now place the settings you want to apply, try the ones you want the most, but if you want to effectively separate the instrumental or sounds from the vocals, I recommend the following settings:

| To separate the instrumental from the vocals | To separate other typo of audios |
| :------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------: |
| <ImageZoom src="/images/karafan-vocals.png" alt="Karafan Vocals" width={800} height={400} /> | <ImageZoom src="/images/karafan-other.png" alt="Karafan Other" width={800} height={400} /> |

3. We click on **Start** and it will begin to separate the chosen song. At the end of the process, the message **Processing DONE** will appear at the end of the interface.

4. Now we go to the **Results** folder and we will find a folder with the name of our song or audio. There we will find a list of audios, we download the audio with the name **Vocal Final**, in case you want the instrumental one that says **Music Final**.
</Step>
<Step>
### How to update?

Simply **Run the Setup.py** file!

For more information, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
## Google Colab
<Step>
### Enter the KaraFan interface

In our Google Drive, we created the folder **Music** where we will put our songs to separate, and **Vocals** where our already separated song will be stored

<Callout type="warn" className="shadow-xl shadow-orange-500/10">
  The Colab only lasts 30 minutes in execution. Additionally, it is possible
  that Colab may disconnect after a few hours due to Google’s limitations.
</Callout>

First, we go to the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eddycrack864/KaraFan/blob/master/KaraFan_Improved_Version.ipynb).

Run the cell by clicking on the white play icon button. So that the repository can start to be cloned.

Then we click on the next cell **This is it!** to load the KaraFan interface.

</Step>
<Step>
### Process your audio

Now we have to copy **the path of your song** that you want to separate and the path of the **folder** where the separated song will be stored.

Now place the settings you want to apply, try the ones you want the most, but if you want to effectively separate the instrumental or sounds from the vocals, I recommend the following settings:

| To separate the instrumental from the vocals | To separate other typoe of audios |
| :------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------: |
| <ImageZoom src="/images/karafan-vocals.png" alt="Karafan Vocals" width={800} height={400} /> | <ImageZoom src="/images/karafan-other.png" alt="Karafan Other" width={800} height={400} /> |

We click on **Start** and it will begin to separate the chosen song. At the end of the process, the message **Processing DONE** will appear at the end of the interface.

<Callout type="info" className="shadow-xl shadow-blue-500/10">
  The first time you use it, it will start downloading the models you have
  selected in your drive in the **KaraFan_user** folder. If you keep this folder
  for the next time you want to use it, you will not need to download it again.
</Callout>

Now we go to the **Vocals** folder and we will find a folder with the name of our song or audio. There we will find a list of audios, we download the audio with the name **Vocal Final**, in case you want the instrumental one that says **Music Final**.
</Step>
<Step>
### Code to be afk

To run this code in Colab, we have to press the keys **Ctrl + Shift + i** to open the **developer tools** option and the following window will open. In case another window is displayed, we can locate it by selecting the **Console** option, so in this way Colab will not disconnect during the separation process. First, we put **Allow pasting**, then we press enter and only then it will let us enter the code.

```js
function ClickConnect() {
  var iconElement = document.getElementById("toggle-header-button");
  if (iconElement) {
    var clickEvent = new MouseEvent("click", {
      bubbles: true,
      cancelable: true,
      view: window,
    });
    iconElement.dispatchEvent(clickEvent);
  }
}
setInterval(ClickConnect, 6000);
```
