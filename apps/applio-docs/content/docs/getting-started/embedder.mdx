## What are embedders?

Embedders are neural network models that convert raw audio input into high-dimensional vector representations. These representations capture essential acoustic and linguistic features of the audio, making them crucial for various audio processing tasks, including voice conversion.

## How to use embedders?

Embedders are used in two main stages of the voice conversion process:

- **Training:** Select the embedder in the extraction settings.
- **Inference:** Choose the same embedder in the advanced settings.

  It is critical to use the same embedder for both training and inference. The
  embedder used to train the pretrained model must be consistent throughout the
  entire process.

## Where to find embedders?

You can find a variety of embedders on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=feature-extraction&sort=trending&search=Hubert). To narrow down your search:

1. Visit the Hugging Face model hub.
2. Apply the "Feature Extraction" filter.
3. Search for specific embedder types (e.g., "HuBERT", "Contentvec").
4. Sort by trending or other relevant metrics to find popular and well-maintained models.

  When choosing an embedder, consider factors such as model size, supported
  languages, and community adoption.

## Best practices

- Experiment with different embedders to find the best fit for your specific voice conversion task.
- Keep track of which embedder you use for each model to ensure consistency.
- Stay updated with the latest developments in audio embedders, as new models may offer improved performance.
