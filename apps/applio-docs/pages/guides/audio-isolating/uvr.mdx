# Audio isolating with UVR5

Ultimate vocal remover (UVR) is an Free and Open Source AI audio editing tool with the ability to remove stems and other objects from a base audio. It is possible to execute the program through several ways, this section will explain how to use each of them.
<Steps>
## Alternative 1: Locally execution
### Download UVR5

To start using uvr locally, download and install the program via https://ultimatevocalremover.com/

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
When running the installer, Windows may mistakenly detect it as malware due to the lack of a license. If you have any concerns, you can review the program's source code or use alternative installation methods.
</Callout>

### Download Models 
When inside UVR, you first need to download separation models.

- Click on the 🔧 icon.
- Go to “Download Center”.
- Choose your preferred models.

In the section you will find models structures, these are one of the best known:
<Tabs items={['RoFormer', 'MDX-Net', 'Vr Arch', 'Demucs']}>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  **RoFormer** utilizes a Band-Split module to convert the input complex spectrogram into representations at the subband level *(currently the best)*. 
  
  The RoFormer method contains two pretrained models, **BS-RoFormer** and **Mel-Band RoFormer**, which contain similar but not same structures, currently the best versions of these models are:

 - **BS-Roformer-Viperx-1297:** The best to separate vocals and instrumental.
 - **Mel-Roformer-Viperx-1143:** Separate vocals and instrumental.

  **For higher quality, use custom models**
 <FAQBox title="Custom Models">
 - **[Kim Mel Roformer](https://huggingface.co/shiromiya/audio-separation-models/tree/main/Kim-MelRoformer):** The best local model to separate vocals and instrumental.
 - **[Aufr33 and Viperx Mel Roformer Karaoke](https://huggingface.co/shiromiya/audio-separation-models/tree/main/mel_band_roformer_karaoke_aufr33_viperx):** The best model for separating main vocals from backing vocals.
 - **[anvuew Mel Roformer dereverb](https://huggingface.co/anvuew/dereverb_mel_band_roformer/tree/main):** The best model for removing reverb from audios *(only removes stereo reverb)*.
 - **[Aufr33 Mel Roformer Denoise](https://huggingface.co/jarredou/aufr33_MelBand_Denoise/resolve/main):** The best model for removing noise from audios.
 
 For information on how to use these models in the UVR, go to [Custom Models Information](#custom-models)
</FAQBox>

 If you want to use these models, you need to download the following [patch](https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/uvr_update_patches/UVR_Patch_4_14_24_18_7_BETA_full_Roformer.exe).

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  **MDX-net** is a prize-winning model framework from an ML enthusiasts contest, designed for audio source separation and enabling improvements from a base model.

  - **MDX23C-InstVoc HQ:** A set of different models that works to deliver a single result.
  - **UVR-MDX-NET Voc FT:** Model focused mainly on separating vocals.
  - **UVR-MDX-NET Crowd HQ 1:** separate background vocals from a main one.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
**Vr-Arch** is a location-guided audio-visual spatial audio separator model, capable of giving great results in most tasks.

  - **UVR-DeEcho-DeReverb:** Separate Reverb and echo.
  - **UVR-BVE-4B_SN-44100-1:** Multiple background voices separator.
  - **5_Hp-Karaoke-UVR:** Separate Background vocals (best one).
  - **UVR-DeNoise:** Remove Noise and some artifacts.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
   **Demucs** is an all-in-one model capable of separating most objects from an audio between 4 to 6 stems. Being their best version of DemucsV4. 
  - **htdemucs:** Default Model, normal proccesing time and good results.
  - **htdemucs_ft:** Slow processing but better results.
  - **htdemucs_6s:** Capability of separing Guitar and Piano stems.
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs> 
### Make the Audio conversion

When the models have been downloaded, you can go back to the home screen to make your separation.

- Select the desired structure and the downloaded model.
- Select your audio, it can be easily downloaded from sites such as [Cobalt.Tools](https://cobalt.tools/)
- Select the output path for the results and click convert.

<FAQBox title="Other Options">
- **Segment Size:** Larger consumes more resources, but may give better results.
- **Overlap:** Amount of overlap between prediction windows.
- **Window Size:** Change the audio processing bucket, a lower number indicates a much slower processing but a better worked result, and vice versa with a higher number.
- **Aggression Settings:** Change the aggressiveness with which the separation will be performed, a higher number can eat important frequencies of the audio.

## Alternative 2: MVSEP

MVSEP is a website belonging to the **UVR team** which offers a fast and direct way to use the software in the cloud with a free version and paid upgrades.

To use mvsep, it is as easy as enter to their website (https://mvsep.com/) and registering. Apart from the mentioned models, MVSEP has some exclusive models, which are:

- **BSRoformer (ver 2024.08)** or **MelBand Roformer (ver 2024.08):** The best models to separate instrumental and vocals.
- **Bandit v2:** Remove SFX, speech, music, effects.
- **DeNoise by aufr23 (Standard & Aggressive):** Remove noise and some artifacts.

## <a id="custom-models">Custom Models Information</a>
**Important:** You need to use **overlap 2** on these models

<Steps>
### Step 1: Place models in the correct folder
To use these models, you need to place the `.ckpt` and `.yaml` files in the following folders:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <div style={{ margin: '0 10px' }}>
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.Folder name="C:" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="Ultimate Vocal Remover" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.Folder name="models" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="MDX_Net_Models" defaultOpen>
              <FileTree.File name="model.ckpt" />
              <FileTree.Folder name="model_data" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.Folder name="mdx_c_configs" defaultOpen>
                  <FileTree.File name="config.yaml" />
                </FileTree.Folder>
              </FileTree.Folder>
            </FileTree.Folder>
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 2: Select the model in UVR
After placing the files in the folders, in UVR, select the model, this will open a window asking you to select the configuration file, select the model's `.yaml` file and check `Roformer Model`
