<Aside type="caution">
  Before starting. Note that launching any external interfaces (UIs) through Google Colaboratory is against the ToS of the platform. Running these can cause **limitations to your Google Account**, if you understand the risks you can continue to use the following alternative.

  Otherwise you can choose to use others such as [Applio No UI.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iahispano/applio/blob/master/assets/Applio_NoUI.ipynb)
</Aside>

## Applio UI Colab

### Enter the [Applio Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iahispano/applio/blob/master/assets/Applio.ipynb)

When inside execute the following **two cells**

### Access the interface
You will find that when the first **“Install Applio”** cell finishes executing the next one will give a URL, normally this is offered via gradio, but currently this tunnel disconnects the execution environment, it is recommended to choose **“localtunnel”** as the sharing method and do the following

- Copy the given IP on Collab.
- Open the given URL.
- Paste the IP as the password.

and yap, that's all, have fun using the Applio UI version!

<Aside type="note">
In case you want to train in the UI version, it is advisable to use the extra cells in order not to lose progress in case of disconnection.
</Aside>

## Extra cells (only for training)

- **Sync with Google Drive:**
Saves any trained model in colab to `ApplioBackup` in your mounted Google Drive, and links that folder back to colab to continue training in previously saved models. Drive needs to be mounted first, you can either manually mount drive yourself or use the cell from the **"Install Applio"** category.

### Options inside UI

- **Dataset Maker:** Upload your audio directly to its proper path via the interface.

- **Or manual audio upload:** Place your audio in a folder on your Google Drive, run the Mount Cell, enter collab's file explorer 📁, copy the path to the folder (`Drive/content/drive/MyDrive/My_custom_folderd`)

- **Save Only Latest:** Replace the same D/G file newer data. This help to prevent filling up storage.

- **Download Pretrained Models:** Download the custom pretrained models directly from the Download tab in Applio in case of **Download all custom pretrains** cell is not working.

## How to export my model to my Google Drive?

To save your model, there are three ways to do it:

- **Finished Model:** Go to the **Export Model** section in the **Train** tab, click on the **Refresh** button and select the pth and the added index of the model to export. Finally, click on the **Upload** button, your model will be found in the **ApplioExported** folder ready to be used.

- **Model to continue training:** If you want to save all the files of your model folder in your Drive, you just need to run the **Sync with Drive** cell (if Google Drive is mounted, otherwise go to the **Install Applio** category and run **Mount Drive** cell), your model folder will be found inside the **ApplioBackup** folder.

- **Manual (NOT RECOMMENDED):** Click on 📁 in Colab and locate the files **"model_\*e_\*s.pth"** and **"model.index"** of your model in `Applio/logs/model`. From there you can either Download them by clicking ⋮ and Download, or by dragging them to `drive/MyDrive/SomeFolder` (if it is mounted).

## How to resume training in Google Colab?

If the model still needs training, simply do the following:

- Run every cell, including **Sync with Google Drive**.

- Then, in the Applio interface, input your **model name**, use the same **sample rate**, and proceed to the last part of the train tab. Set the same **[batch size](/images/faq#terminology)**, **[pretrained](/images/getting-started/pretrained/) (if you used)** and increase the number of epochs you want to train.

### Code to be afk

If you want to remain inactive without fear of being disconnected from your environment run this Java Script on your browser console, press the keys **Ctrl + Shift + i** to open the **developer tools** option and the following window will open. In case another window is displayed, we can locate it by selecting the **Console** option, so in this way Colab will not disconnect during the separation process. First, we put **Allow pasting**, then we press enter and only then it will let us enter the code.

```js
function ClickConnect() {
  var iconElement = document.getElementById("toggle-header-button");
  if (iconElement) {
    var clickEvent = new MouseEvent("click", {
      bubbles: true,
      cancelable: true,
      view: window,
    });
    iconElement.dispatchEvent(clickEvent);
  }
}
setInterval(ClickConnect, 6000);
```
