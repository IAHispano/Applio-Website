**Plugins** are extensions that add new features and functionality to Applio without needing to update the entire application. They can provide new tools, new tabs in the interface, or new options for audio processing.

## Installing Plugins

You can install plugins in two ways: through the Applio interface or manually.

### Method 1: Use the Plugin Installer

This is the easiest and recommended way to install plugins.

<Steps>
1.  Download the plugin you want to install. Plugins are usually distributed as `.zip` files.
2.  In the Applio interface, go to the **Plugins** tab.
3.  Drag and drop the plugin's `.zip` file into the **Plugin Installer** box.
4.  Refresh the Applio interface. The new plugin's features should now be available.
</Steps>

### Method 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer, you can also install plugins manually.

<Steps>
1.  Download and extract the plugin's `.zip` file.
2.  Move the extracted folder to the `Applio/tabs/Plugins/installed` directory in your Applio installation.
3.  Restart Applio.
</Steps>

## Finding Plugins

You can find a collection of official and community-made plugins on the [Applio Plugins GitHub repository](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio-Plugins/releases/latest).

## Updating Plugins

To update a plugin, simply follow the same installation steps with the new version of the plugin. It will overwrite the old version.
