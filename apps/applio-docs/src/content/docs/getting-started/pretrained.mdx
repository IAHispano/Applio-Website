## What are Pre-trained Models?

A **pre-trained model** is a base model that has already been trained on a large amount of data. When you train your own voice model, you can start from scratch or you can use a pre-trained model as a starting point.

Using a pre-trained model can save you a significant amount of time and effort, and it can often lead to better results, especially if you have a small dataset.

## How to Use a Pre-trained Model

To use a pre-trained model in Applio:

1.  In the **Train** tab, check the **Custom Pretrained** box.
2.  Upload the pre-trained model's `.pth` and `.index` files.
3.  Select the pre-trained model from the **Pretrained G/D Path** dropdown menus.
4.  Proceed with your training as usual.

  You can download many popular pre-trained models directly from the **Download** tab in Applio.

## How to Create Your Own Pre-trained Model

You can also create your own pre-trained models to use as a base for future projects.

-   **From Scratch:** To create a pre-trained model from scratch, you'll need a large, diverse dataset (50+ hours of audio is recommended). Train a model on this dataset as you normally would, but without using an existing pre-trained model.
-   **Fine-tuning an Existing Model:** You can also fine-tune an existing pre-trained model to create a new one. For example, you could fine-tune a general-purpose English model on a dataset of a specific accent to create a pre-trained model for that accent.

When creating pre-trained models, it's important to use high-quality, non-copyrighted audio.
