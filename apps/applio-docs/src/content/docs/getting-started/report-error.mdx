If you encounter an error while using Applio, this guide will help you report it effectively and find solutions to common problems.

## How to Report an Error

Before reporting a new error, please check the [Common Errors and Solutions](#common-errors-and-solutions) section below to see if your issue is already known.

If you can't find a solution, you can report the error in two ways:

### Method 1: GitHub Issues

This is the preferred method for reporting bugs.

<Steps>
1.  Go to the [Applio GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/issues) page.
2.  Click on **New Issue**.
3.  Provide a clear and descriptive title for the issue.
4.  In the description, include a screenshot of the error and the full text from the Applio command line window.
5.  Describe the steps you took to encounter the error.
</Steps>

### Method 2: Built-in Bug Reporter

You can also use Applio's built-in bug reporter.

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Installation and Dependency Errors

<Aside type="tip">
  Applio is installed in a self-contained Conda environment with all the necessary dependencies. You shouldn't need to install anything else manually.
</Aside>

-   **Miniconda Download Fails:** If the automatic download of Miniconda fails, you can [download and install it manually](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.9.0-0-Windows-x86_64.exe).
-   **Conda "Wheels" Errors:** This usually means that the Visual Studio Build Tools are not installed correctly. The Applio installer should handle this automatically, but you may need to install them manually.
-   **TensorBoard or Dependency Errors:** These errors usually indicate that the dependencies were not installed correctly. Make sure you are using the [latest version of the installer](/getting-started/installation/) and that your system meets the installation requirements.

### Installation Requirements Checklist

-   **Path Issues:** Did you install Applio in a directory with spaces or special characters in the path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Applio`)? If so, please reinstall it in a simple path like `C:\Applio`.
-   **Antivirus/Firewall:** Did you have your antivirus or firewall enabled during installation? These can sometimes interfere with the installation process. Try reinstalling with them temporarily disabled.
-   **Administrator Privileges:** Did you run the `run-applio.bat` file with administrator privileges? If so, try running it normally, without administrator rights.

### Runtime Errors

-   **FFmpeg and UTF-8 Errors:** These errors are often caused by special characters in file paths or filenames. Make sure all your file and folder names use standard ASCII characters.
-   **Connection Issues:** If you can't connect to the Applio interface, make sure the console window is running and that your firewall is not blocking the connection.
-   **Proxy Issues:** If you're using a system-wide proxy, try disabling it and then refreshing the Applio interface.
-   **GPU Memory Issues:** If you run out of GPU memory during training, try reducing the **Batch Size**. If it happens during inference, you may need to adjust your settings in the `config.py` file.
-   **CPU Processing Issues:** If your CPU is struggling, try reducing the **Number of CPU threads** in the training settings. You can also pre-process your dataset into shorter audio clips.
