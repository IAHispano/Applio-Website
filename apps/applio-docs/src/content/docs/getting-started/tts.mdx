Applio includes a built-in Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature that allows you to generate audio from text and then convert it to the voice of your chosen model, all without needing to use external software.

## How to Use the TTS Feature

<Steps>
1.  Go to the **TTS** tab in the Applio interface.
2.  **Select Your Model:** Choose the voice model you want to use from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Select a TTS Voice:** Choose a TTS voice from the list. These voices are provided by EdgeTTS and are available in a variety of languages.
4.  **Enter Your Text:** Type or paste the text you want to convert into the text box. You can also upload a `.txt` file.
5.  **Adjust the Speed:** Use the slider to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
6.  **Convert:** Click the **Convert** button to start the process.
</Steps>

## Important Information

Applio's TTS feature is powered by **EdgeTTS**, which has a few limitations:

-   **Internet Connection Required:** EdgeTTS requires an active internet connection to function.
-   **Limited Voices:** You can only use the voices that are provided by EdgeTTS. It is not possible to add custom voices.
-   **Audio Length Limit:** The maximum audio length is currently limited to 10 minutes per request due to Azure's free tier restrictions.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you're looking for more advanced TTS options, consider using the [ElevenLabs plugin](/getting-started/plugins) or generating audio with a different TTS platform and then using Applio's standard [inference](/getting-started/inference) features to convert the voice.
