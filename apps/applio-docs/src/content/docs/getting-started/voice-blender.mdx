The **Voice Blender** is a unique feature in Applio that allows you to fuse two existing voice models into a single new model. This can be a fun way to experiment and create new, unique voices.

## How to Use the Voice Blender

<Steps>
1.  Go to the **Voice Blender** tab in the Applio interface.
2.  **Enter a Name:** Give your new, blended model a unique name.
3.  **Select Model A:** Drag and drop the `.pth` file for your first model into the "Model A" box.
4.  **Select Model B:** Drag and drop the `.pth` file for your second model into the "Model B" box.
5.  **Adjust the Blend Ratio:** Use the slider to adjust the blend ratio between the two models. A value of `0.5` will create an even blend, while a value closer to `0` will favor Model A, and a value closer to `1` will favor Model B.
6.  **Fuse:** Click the **Fusion** button to create your new model.
</Steps>

Your new blended model will be saved in the `Applio/logs` directory and will be available for use in the [Inference](/getting-started/inference) tab.

  Blended models do not have an index file, so you will not need to select one when using them for inference.

## Tips for Best Results

-   **Experiment:** The best way to get interesting results with the Voice Blender is to experiment with different combinations of models and blend ratios.
-   **Use Similar Models:** You'll often get the best results when blending models that have similar vocal characteristics.
-   **Start with a 50/50 Blend:** A good starting point is to set the blend ratio to `0.5` and then adjust from there.
