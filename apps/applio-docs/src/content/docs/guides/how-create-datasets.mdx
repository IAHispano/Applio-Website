A **dataset** is a collection of clean, high-quality audio files of a single speaker that Applio uses to train a voice model. The quality of your dataset is the single most important factor in achieving good training results. A high-quality dataset consists of clear, consistent, and noise-free audio.

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a great dataset.

## Dataset Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Source Your Audio

First, you need to collect audio of the person or character you want to create a voice model for.

<Aside type="tip" title="Best Practices for Audio Sourcing">
-   **Audio Format:** Your audio files should be in a lossless format like **WAV** or **FLAC**.
-   **Duration:** Aim for a total duration of **10 to 30 minutes**. Less than 10 minutes may not be enough for good results, and more than 30 minutes can lead to diminishing returns.
-   **Variety:** The dataset should include a wide range of tones, pitches, and emotions to create a versatile voice model.
-   **Quality:** The audio should be as clean as possible, with minimal background noise, reverb, or other artifacts.
</Aside>

### Step 2: Isolate the Vocals

If your audio contains background music or other sounds, you'll need to isolate the vocals. For a detailed guide on how to do this, please see our [audio isolation guide](/guides/uvr/).

### Step 3: Clean and Process Your Audio with Audacity

Once you have your vocal recordings, it's time to clean and process them using a free audio editor like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/).

#### Noise Reduction

Noise reduction helps to remove unwanted background noise from your recordings.

<Steps>
1.  In Audacity, select a small portion of your audio that contains only background noise.
2.  Go to **Effect > Noise Removal and Repair > Noise Reduction**.
3.  Click **Get Noise Profile**.
4.  Now, select the entire audio track.
5.  Go back to the **Noise Reduction** effect and click **OK** to apply it.
</Steps>

#### Noise Gate

A noise gate is used to silence parts of the audio that are below a certain volume threshold. This is great for removing low-level noise between words and sentences.

<Steps>
1.  Select your entire audio track.
2.  Go to **Effect > Gating > Noise Gate**.
3.  Apply the recommended settings as shown in the image below. These settings are a good starting point, but you may need to adjust them based on your audio.
</Steps>

#### Truncate Silence

This effect removes long periods of silence from your audio, which helps to create a more concise dataset.

<Steps>
1.  Select your entire audio track.
2.  Go to **Effect > Truncate / Silence > Truncate Silence**.
3.  Apply the recommended settings as shown in the image below.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Before truncating silence, make sure your audio contains only speech. Manually remove any non-speech sounds like coughs, breaths, or clicks.
</Aside>

### Step 4: Export Your Dataset

Once you're happy with your audio, it's time to export it.

<Steps>
1.  Go to **File > Export > Export as WAV** (or FLAC).
2.  Choose a location to save your file.
3.  Ensure the format is set to **WAV (Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM** or **FLAC**.
4.  Click **Export**.
</Steps>

| WAV Export Settings | FLAC Export Settings |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![A screenshot of the WAV export settings in Audacity.](/images/wav.png) | ![A screenshot of the FLAC export settings in Audacity.](/images/flac.png) |

<Aside type="note">
You can export your dataset as a single audio file or as multiple smaller files. If you choose to split your audio, aim for each file to be between 10 and 15 seconds long.
</Aside>

Your dataset is now ready for [training](/getting-started/training/)!

## Recommended Audio Editing Plugins

While Audacity is a powerful tool on its own, you can extend its functionality with plugins. These plugins work with Audacity, FL Studio, and other DAWs.

-   **[T-De-Esser](https://techivation.com/t-de-esser/)**: A de-esser is a tool that reduces sibilance, which is the harsh "s" sound in speech. This is a must-have for creating clean vocal recordings.
-   **[ReaPlugs](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/)**: A suite of powerful plugins from the creators of the Reaper DAW. It includes a more advanced noise gate, EQ, and compressor.
-   **[Auburn Sounds Renegate](https://www.auburnsounds.com/products/Renegate.html)**: A sophisticated noise gate plugin that gives you more control than Audacity's built-in noise gate.
