**KaraFan** is a powerful, free tool for separating audio sources. It can extract vocals from a song, remove instruments, and more. This makes it an excellent tool for creating clean datasets for voice model training.

For more information, you can visit the official [KaraFan GitHub repository](https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan).

## Installation

You can run KaraFan on your local computer or on Google Colab.

  KaraFan requires an NVIDIA GPU for local installation.

<Steps>
1.  Create a folder on your PC where you want to store the KaraFan project.
2.  Download and install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe). If you have another version of Python installed, you must uninstall it first.
3.  Download the [KaraFan installer](https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan/wiki/Data/Install.bat) (right-click and save as `Install.bat`).
4.  On Windows 11, you may need to unblock the `.bat` file. Right-click the file, go to **Properties**, and click the **Unlock** button in the **General** tab.
5.  Run the `Install.bat` file with administrator rights.
6.  Once the installation is complete, run `Setup.py` by double-clicking on it.
7.  You can now launch KaraFan by double-clicking on `KaraFan.pyw`.

<Steps>
1.  Open the [KaraFan Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eddycrack864/KaraFan/blob/master/KaraFan_Improved_Version.ipynb).
2.  In your Google Drive, create a folder named `Music` for your input audio files and a folder named `Vocals` for the output files.
3.  Run the first cell in the notebook to clone the KaraFan repository.
4.  Run the second cell, labeled "This is it!", to launch the KaraFan interface.
</Steps>
<Aside type="note">
  The first time you use the Colab notebook, it will download the necessary models to a `KaraFan_user` folder in your Google Drive. If you keep this folder, you won't need to download the models again next time.
