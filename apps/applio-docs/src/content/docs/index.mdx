Applio is a powerful, AI-driven voice conversion tool that enables you to create personalized voices or utilize a variety of pre-existing voices. Whether you prefer local installation or cloud-based usage through Google Colab, Applio is designed to be efficient and user-friendly.

## What is Applio and Where Can I Use It?

Applio allows you to easily perform voice conversion tasks, whether by creating custom voices or utilizing existing ones. With a flexible design, it supports both local installation for users with sufficient hardware resources and cloud access via Google Colab for those with limited computing power.

### Hardware Requirements for Local Installation:

- **Voice Training:** For performing voice conversion locally, your system should be equipped with a **Nvidia RTX 2000 series** graphics card or higher to ensure optimal performance.
- **Voice Inference:** If your goal is to use pre-existing voices, Applio will run efficiently on most standard hardware configurations.

## Quick Start Guide

### For Beginners
If you're new to voice conversion, we recommend starting with these steps:

<Steps>
1. **Install Applio**: Choose between [local installation](/getting-started/installation/) or [cloud-based alternatives](/getting-started/other-alternatives/)
2. **Learn the Interface**: Start with [inference](/getting-started/inference/) to understand how Applio works
3. **Create Your First Cover**: Follow our step-by-step guide below
</Steps>

### For Advanced Users
If you're experienced with voice conversion tools:
