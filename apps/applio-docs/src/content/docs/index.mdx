**Welcome to Applio!** Whether you're looking to create AI-powered song covers, train custom voice models, or simply experiment with voice conversion, you've come to the right place.

Applio is a powerful, user-friendly tool designed for everyone, from complete beginners to seasoned experts. You can run it on your own computer or use it in the cloud with Google Colab.

<Aside type="note">
  For local voice training, we recommend an **Nvidia RTX 20-series GPU or newer** for the best experience. For voice inference (using existing models), most modern computers will work just fine.
